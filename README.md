 ## Project `presentation`
 
The greedy snake is a single-player game built with the aim of entertaining \ (•◡•) / The objective is to grow the longest tail possible without self-colliding or surpassing the screen limits.
Python 3.11 version 

### Description and controls
The snake object is displayed in the screen at the beginning of the game (shown in red) and can be controlled by the user by using the **cursor keys** (left, up, right and down) left ← &#8592, up ↑ &#8593,
right → &#8594 down ↓ &#8595 

If no direction is indicated by the user, the snake will keep moving in the `same direction.`

### How it works
- The snake feeds up of eating pink candies, displayed randomly throughout the screen while the game is still on. The user `must avoid` colliding with the tail of the snake and crossing the borders of the screen. Otherwise the game is re-started. As an extra difficulty, the speed is `increased` as points are being scored


- **Everytime a candy is eaten, 1 extra point is scored.**

- Traps `(shown in black)` also pop up in random positions of the screen and should be avoided. 

- **Everytime the snake collides with a trap, -2 points are scored**

The creation of the game was inspired by the famously known `snake game` developed by Gremlin and released in 1976.

### Known issues
When re-started, there's sometimes a slight delay before the objects are moved to its original position 

### Authors 
The original project was developed by Lena Chen and Yasmina Rocio
